# Mark and Scott Learn to Code - the BUILD 2023 "Locknote" featuring GitHub Copilot Chat and Visual Studio

This is the Asteroids Game generated by Scott and Mark Learn to Code, commited directly as written, just after BUILD 2023 keynote. Many many thanks to Yanan Cai for her help and prompt engineering.

If you want to try to start where we started and follow along, generating code with GitHub Copilot, check out the "startpoint" branch - that's where we started!

## Project Structure 
AsteroidsGame solition is a .Net Web App which implements the multi-player game backend in C# and front end canvas in Javascript using SignalR technology. 

All game backend is under AsteroidsGame project, including:
- SignalR Hub
- Core game logic
- Framing queue and service
- Asteroid, bullet, spaceship/player classes.

All game Javascript and other rendering resources are under wwwroot folder.
